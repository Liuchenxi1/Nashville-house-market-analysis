### **Motivation**   
As a homeowner in Nashville, TN, one of the “hottest” cities across the nation, I was interested in studying the housing market here compared to similar cities. There has been a dramatic change in prices for property sales and rental homes within the last several years following the 2008 economic crash. I chose 3 cities to analyze and compare: Los Angeles, CA., Atlanta, GA., and Nashville, TN. I want to look at the data to understand the current market value compared to the market value before 2008 leading up to the economic crash.

### **Data Questions**  
- Where is the Nashville housing market monetarily valued, currently? 
- What is the cost to buy/rent in Nashville, TN compared to other cities? 
- What are the signs leading to the housing market change?
- What will the future housing market in Nashville, TN look like? 


### **Findings**
- 
![ The Average Housing Price Trends In Three Cities (2000-2021 )](https://github.com/Liuchenxi1/go_to_themoon/tree/main/data/average_housing_price.png)
●	There was a significant drop in prices during 2008-2013 in L.A. and Atlanta, however, Nashville prices didn’t receive the same impact as other two. This implies that the Nashville housing market may be a safe place to invest even when signs point to another decline in the economy.

●	The average rental costs are increasing each year. From the city and population size, Nashville has had a positive sign for rental profitability since 2014. This means, as the city continues to grow in population, the rental properties will become more valuable. There is at least 7% room for Nashville rentals to be higher in price.

### **Known Issues and Challenges** 
Known: 
The main data collections are from an online source, Zillow.com. I also researched data from other housing websites to match the numbers. 
Challenges: 
The first challenge is the U.S. census database is not helpful for this specific presentation. I found the website was less detailed and focused on the cities’ data overall. It reports the whole state’s data instead of the details in counties. 
Secondly, the signs leading up to the housing market change. There are too many causes that can be linked to the economic crash. It is hard to make assumptions for the future economic possibilities when there is not one specific cause that I could guarantee would lead to the crash.

When I purchased my house, I focused on the elements I felt were most important.
